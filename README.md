# Gmail_reply_agent_n8n
This project is an AI-powered Gmail Auto-Reply Agent developed using n8n and Groq LLM. The agent monitors incoming emails, analyzes their content using an LLM, and automatically creates intelligent, structured reply drafts before sending them via the Gmail AP

I developed a Gmail Auto-Reply AI Agent using n8n and Groq (LLaMA 3.1).

The agent:
- Monitors incoming emails
- Understands email context using LLM
- Generates intelligent draft replies
- Sends structured responses automatically

This project helped me understand:
- Tool calling
- Structured output parsing
- Agent workflows
- LLM integration with APIs

Excited to build more agent-based systems!
